        <h2>What is Doom?</h2>
        <p>
            Doom (officially cased DOOM and occasionally DooM by fans,
            based on the Doom logo) is the first release of the Doom series,
            and one of the games that consolidated the first-person shooter genre.
            With a science fiction and horror style,
            it gives the players the role of marines who find themselves in the focal point of an invasion from Hell.
            The game introduced deathmatch and cooperative play in the explicit sense,
            and helped further the practice of allowing and encouraging fan-made modifications of commercial video
            games.
            It was first released on December 10, 1993, when a shareware copy was uploaded to an FTP server at the
            University of Wisconsin.
            The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995
            and sold at retail.

        <h2>Who is Doomslayer?</h2>
        <p>
            In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine,
            who became popularly nicknamed "Doomguy" by the community before being retconned as Doom Slayer,
            fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one third of the game, nine levels,
            distributed as shareware,
            Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people within two years of its release,
            popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS
            genre,
            it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming,
            and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs".
            As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s,
            helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "Doom clones". Its graphic violence,
            as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.

        <h2>Sequel</h2>
        <p>
            The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous
            expansion packs,
            including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS,
            the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in
            1997,
            it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices.
            The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the
            mid-1990s,
            although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original.
            The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a horror-focused game
            using id Tech 4,
            with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6,
            was released in 2016 and focused on returning to fast paced action of the first two games. In 2019, a second
            Doom movie was released,
            titled Doom: Annihilation. On March 20, 2020, Doom Eternal was released as a sequel to Doom (2016).

        <h2>Soundeffects</h2>
        <p>
            All of Doom music was composed by Robert Prince.
            The fourth episode added in The Ultimate Doom did not include any new tracks and only used songs from the
            first three episodes.
            Many of the songs were inspired by or closely mirror popular rock and metal songs of that era,
            from groups such as Alice in Chains,
            D.R.I, Metallica, Pantera and Slayer.
