            <h2>What is Mortal Kombat</h2>
            <p>
                Mortal Kombat,
                video game series in the fighting genre created by the Midway Manufacturing Company of the United
                States.
                Mortal Kombat debuted as a two-dimensional arcade game in 1992 and went on to become one of the most
                popular
                video games in the 1990s.
                The original arcade game spawned many sequels and expansions across a wide array of console gaming
                systems,
                generated a line of toys,
                and inspired two motion pictures: Mortal Kombat (1995) and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997).

            <h2>Why did it became popular</h2>
            <p>
                In Mortal Kombat players select one of many unique characters to battle against other fighters in a
                gauntlet-style tournament to determine who faces the final ‚Äúboss.‚Äù
                Among the game‚Äôs notable points is a vast catalogue of special techniques for each fighter that can be
                performed by entering an intricate series of commands on the controller.
                One of these techniques, the finishing move, gained particular notoriety because,
                if players quickly pressed the right combination of buttons on the controller,
                the defeated opponent would be brutally maimed,
                humiliated, or otherwise defiled.
                Because of the excessive amount of simulated blood, violence, and gore,
                Mortal Kombat faced intense public scrutiny. In fact, Mortal Kombat and other comparable games
                eventually
                gave rise to the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
                The advent of a rating system resulted in later versions of the game featuring the ability to restrict
                the
                violence in the game via game-play settings, but,
                as the series was founded on characters spraying blood and falling into spiked pits,
                the game‚Äôs premise and overall feel remained the same.
                As advances in technology and a departure from Mortal Kombat‚Äôs classic style began,
                the game faded in popularity and sales.

            <h2>Boss in Mortal Kombat</h2>
            <p>
                The boss is the final opponent that the player must face at the top of the battle plan after having
                braved
                their way through the ranks of other fighters and usually the final "test" to the player's skill in the
                game.
                Final bosses are often computer-controlled only, and thus, are unplayable.
                Bosses are always inhuman, often demonic, compared to the cast of characters.
                In addition, they often possess several advantages over the normal characters such as higher resistance
                to
                attacks and much more prominent strength.
                Victory over the boss results in their climatic demise, followed by the selected kombatant's ending, in
                which at times, may be canon.
                On rare occasions, the player may unlock a prize for their success.

            <h2>The movie</h2>
            <p>
                Mortal Kombat is a 1995 action movie, directed by Paul W. S. Anderson.
                It is based on the popular Mortal Kombat series of fighting games by Midway.
                It was filmed in Los Angeles and on location in Thailand.
                The film was considered to be the first major success for video-game movie adaptions,
                coming out a year after the critically disappointing Street Fighter and two years after the disastrous
                flop,
                Super Mario Bros. Director Paul W. S. Anderson would go on to work on a film franchise based on Capcom's
                Resident Evil games.
                Some elements of the film appear to be influenced, in part, by the Bruce Lee film Enter the Dragon.
                For example, both films feature 3 martial artists arriving at a secluded island to fight in a
                tournament,
                held only periodically,
                and overseen by a megalomaniac with aspirations of global expansion and domination and a direct
                relationship
                to the main protagonist.

            <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
            <p>
                Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the compilation album which accompanied the 1995
                film
                Mortal Kombat.
                The album was released together with Mortal Kombat Motion Picture Score.
                The album features primarily electronic dance music (EDM) along with rock music.
                Five of the songs on this album do not appear in the film: "Unlearn (Josh Wink's Live Mix)", "The
                Invisible", "Burn", "Blood & Fire (Out of the Ashes Mix)",
                and "I Reject".
                Three songs from Stabbing Westward were included in the movie,
                but were omitted from the soundtrack: "Lost", "Lies" and "Can't Happen Here",
                all of which appear on the album Ungod.
